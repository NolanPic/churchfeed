**IMPORTANT**: Be sure to read and understand @/docs/specs/spec-instructions.md before proceeding.

Adding on top of the @/docs/specs/2025-11-14-notifications spec, we need to add email as a notification channel.

# Part 1: Email service
We will use Resend for sending emails from the app and, in this case, for sending notifications.

- Install Resend
- Create a new directory: @/app/components/email and create a `Notification.tsx` template
