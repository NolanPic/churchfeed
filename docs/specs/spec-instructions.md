# How to implement a spec

- I will ask you to implement one part of the spec at a time (e.g. "Part 1 - Database changes").
- When you begin on a part, start with asking clarifying questions to ensure you understand the requirements. Be very rigorous in this, and make sure there are NO gaps in your understanding! You can even ask multiple rounds if needed.
- Please ask your questions under a "## Questions" section under the current part (e.g. "Part 2 - Frontend") in the spec document.
- You may add as many follow-up questions underneath this "## Questions" section as needed to fully understand the requirements.
- It is possible that there are inconsistencies or discrepancies in the requirements. It is your job to point these out and suggest improvements.
- Be sure to fully understand the relevant parts of the codebase before you begin. If a relevant part of the codebase is unclear, please ask questions.
- Once you begin coding, if a question comes up that you did not get an answer to previously, **do NOT guess at the answer or decide your own strategy**, just ask a question.
- Try to understand the coding style that is already in the project and follow that, rather than bringing your own style.
- Commit regularly. Do not commit in large chunks. Each commit should have one primary change, e.g. "Add new table to database schema", "Fix duplicates in feed", "Add new mutation for creating posts", etc.
