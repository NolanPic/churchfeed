# churchfeed Product Mission

## Spelling

churchfeed is spelled with one word and all lowercase letters. Incorrect uses are: "ChurchFeed", "Churchfeed", "churchFeed", "church feed".

## Vision

A simple platform for connecting churches and their members through purpose-built communication tools.

## Problem Statement

Church communication is often scattered across multiple platforms that weren't designed with churches in mind. Email, social media, texting, and messaging apps all create fragmentation. It's impossible for the following to all happen in once place:

- Leaders to reach their congregation
- Members to communicate with each other
- Staff to coordinate and plan internally

churchfeed solves this by providing a unified, church-specific communication platform.

## Target Users

Small- to mid-sized churches where many operations are carried out by the people rather than just staff. There are plenty of platforms out there to help church leaders and staff, but not many that help everyone in a church.

### Primary Users

- **Church Goers**: Regular attendees who want to stay connected with their church community and home groups
- **Visitors**: New or occasional attendees seeking to learn more and get involved, or who were invited into a subgroup of the church
- **Church Staff**: Administrative and pastoral staff who need to communicate with members
- **Church Leaders**: Pastors, elders, and ministry leaders who oversee groups and initiatives

### User Needs

- **Church Goers**: Easy access to church updates, ability to engage in discussions, stay connected with their community
- **Visitors**: Welcoming entry point to learn about the church and its activities
- **Staff**: Tools to share announcements, manage feeds, and facilitate communication
- **Leaders**: Ability to organize, moderate, and manage users
- **Group Leaders** Ability to own a feed and its members

## Future
